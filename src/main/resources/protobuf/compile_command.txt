proto to JAVA:
./protoc.exe --java_out=. ProtoData.proto

proto to Python:
./protoc.exe --python_out=. ProtoData.proto



For the issue with protobuf binary wheels:
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install --no-binary=protobuf protobuf

ProtoData.prot is a protofile that degines the data structures that are
being encoded. We are using proto3 syntax, can read more on google on others.

The numbers are not values they are labels for each field for proto

Mission data contains DataPoint so its a list or array of DataPoint
(whatever is inside of MissionData)

In order to use it we need to compile the libararies 2, in java and python

./protoc.exe --java_out=. ProtoData.proto

=. means we want to compile into the same directory, then specify the name of file

we had to add the package to the top of the java file
also need to add proto deppendencies in build.gradle
